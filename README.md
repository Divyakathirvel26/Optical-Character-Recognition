# Optical-Character-Recognition
OCR is a technology for recognizing text in images, such as scanned documents and photos. One of the OCR tools that are often used is Tesseract. Tesseract is an optical character recognition engine for various operating systems.
Currently Tesseract is running well on the Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. Tesseract supports Unicode (UTF-8) and supports more than 100 languages. 
The results obtained from the tesseract are good enough for simple images. Because in the real world it is difficult to find images that are really simple.
